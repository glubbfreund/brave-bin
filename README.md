## What is this?
Its my version of https://github.com/soanvig/brave-bin. I want my own version to have control over the updating process. I made a bash script out of the fish version in the original repo. Thanks again to the original author. Great work. 

## Auto updates
The repository is auto-updated to the latest Brave stable release using Github Actions.
