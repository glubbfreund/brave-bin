## What it is?
Its my version of https://github.com/soanvig/brave-bin. I want my own version to have control over the updating process. I made a bash script out of the fish version in the original repo. This works togheter with my xbps-srcu script. (a [bash script](https://github.com/glubbfreund/dots-linux/blob/master/.local/bin/xbps-srcu) in my dotfiles). Thanks again to the original author. Great work. 

## Auto updates
The repository is auto-updated to the latest Brave stable release using Github Actions.
